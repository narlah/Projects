This small program was created because a good friend of mine Peter said :
If you want to learn you have to create something. Start writing tools for yourself.
I have a mp3 player in my car that accepts flash sd card and plays them sorted alphabetically.
But when i copy 100s of files they all play later in that order - usually albums are metalica xxalbumxx song xx number.
And i like to listen them at random - Ramstein->Manowar->Metalica->Black Sabath->Ramstein ... etc
Not just Ram-Ram-Ram-Sabath-Sabath-Sabath ad infinum.
I got list of files, randomised their order and changed their names to start with numbers so my player would
pick them in the randomised order.
This program started as console - then got a SwingUI, then that ui got progress bar.
And in the end it got a play mp3 capabilities.

Whenever i got plenty of mp3 files sorted on my usb drive i start this program. Navigate to the usb and randomise
the content so the next time i drive - they are shuffled.

PS : creating this made me learn me a lot of stuff - swing, oo, ui, and now i got a maven pom file to build it too:)

Peter if you read this - you were right man! It helps writing those!
