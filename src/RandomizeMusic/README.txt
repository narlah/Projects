This small program was created because a good friend of mine Peter said :
If you want to learn you have to create something. Start writing tools , for yourself. So i did.
So i have a mp3 player in my car that accepts flash sd card and plays them alphabetically.
But when i copy 100s of files they all play later in that order.
And i like to listen them at random - Ramstein->Manowar->Metalica->Black Sabath->Ramstein ... etc
Not just Ram-Ram-Ram-Sabath-Sabath-Sabath ad infinum.
So i got list of files , randomised their order and changed their names to start with numbers so my player would
pick them in the randomised order.
So this program started as console executable - then got a SwingUI , then that ui got progress bar.
And in the end it got a play mp3 capabilities.

So whenever i got plenty of mp3 files sorted on my usb drive i start this program. Navidate to the usb and randomise
the content so next time i drive i get a shuffling.

PS : creating this taught me a lot of stuff - swing, oo , progress bar, and now i got a maven pom file to build it too:)

So Peter if you read this - you were right man! It helps writing those!
